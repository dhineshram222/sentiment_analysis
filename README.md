Overview:

The Sentiment Analysis Project is a machine learning–based application that automatically determines the sentiment of a given text (Positive, Negative, or Neutral). It is particularly useful for analyzing product reviews, customer feedback, or social media content.

The project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, to classify sentiments effectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives:

Automate the process of identifying sentiment from textual data.

Build an accurate and scalable sentiment classification model.

Provide insights that can help businesses, researchers, and organizations understand customer opinions and feedback.

Features:

Preprocessing of raw text (stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, etc.).

Feature extraction using Bag of Words / TF-IDF / Word Embeddings.

Sentiment classification using ML/DL models (e.g., Naïve Bayes, SVM, LSTM, or BERT).

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User interface for inputting text and getting sentiment predictions.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

NLTK / SpaCy – for text preprocessing

Scikit-learn – for ML models & evaluation

TensorFlow / PyTorch – for deep learning models (if used)

Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization

Deployment: Streamlit


Workflow:

Data Collection – Import dataset (e.g., Twitter data, IMDB reviews, Kaggle datasets).

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Extraction – Using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).

Model Training – Train ML/DL models such as Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM.

Model Evaluation – Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Deployment (optional) – Serve predictions through a Flask/Streamlit app.
